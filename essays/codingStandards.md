## The not so bad
Like any good clickbait title, the title of this essay is an overexaduration of my opinion on coding standards. There are some parts of coding standards that are reasonable asks of users. For example, when style guides for Typescript and Javascript say to avoid using var, I agree. When they say they prefer defing new objects with {} and new arrays with [] instead of using new, I agree. Not using " when defining class or object parameters makes them easier to use.
