I read Eric Steven Raymond's essay [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). Then I looked up the top rated questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). And I realized one of two things must be true: either what is considered a smart question has changed in the last two years, or there is more than one way to ask a smart question.

The top rated question on StackOverflow about generics does not follow Raymond's guide to asking a good question. It rather straightforwardly asks [what the difference is between interfaces and types in typescript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37233735/interfaces-vs-types-in-typescript). The question asker does not state that they've read the manual or that they have googled the answer, and yet nobody in the comments is raging at them to _read the f*cking manual_ or _search the f*cking web_. At least, not in the top rated replies.
